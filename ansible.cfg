# config file for ansible -- http://ansible.com/
# ==============================================
# This one specially, describes some tweaks needed for this project to work in certain Amazon AMI

# nearly all parameters can be overridden in ansible-playbook 
# or with command line flags. ansible will read ANSIBLE_CONFIG,
# ansible.cfg in the current working directory, .ansible.cfg in
# the home directory or /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg, whichever it
# finds first

[defaults]

# if set, always use this private key file for authentication, same as 
# if passing --private-key to ansible or ansible-playbook
#private_key_file = /path/to/file

[ssh_connection]

# ssh arguments to use
# Leaving off ControlPersist will result in poor performance, so use 
# paramiko on older platforms rather than removing it
#ssh_args = -o ControlMaster=auto -o ControlPersist=60s

# The path to use for the ControlPath sockets. This defaults to
# "%(directory)s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r", however on some systems with
# very long hostnames or very long path names (caused by long user names or 
# deeply nested home directories) this can exceed the character limit on
# file socket names (108 characters for most platforms). In that case, you 
# may wish to shorten the string below.
# 
# Example: 
# control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r
#control_path = %(directory)s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r
control_path = /tmp/ansible/%%h-%%r

# if True, make ansible use scp if the connection type is ssh 
# (default is sftp)
scp_if_ssh = True
